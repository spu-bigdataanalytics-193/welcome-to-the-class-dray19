## Homework Assignment One
The goal of our first homework was to upload the assignment to github. Our first step was to create a function and use it to print your name in a notebook. The second step was to rename the README.md file to Instructions.md and create a new README.md file which we are in right now. Third was to commit changes and push the code to GitHub.
